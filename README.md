# ArcGIS REST Enhanced For Chrome
A Chrome extension implementing functions from [ESRI REST Diagnostics](https://github.com/raykendo/ESRI_REST_Diagnostics).
## Purpose
ArcGIS Server provides a REST-based endpoint that applications can use to request and edit geographic data. The HTML pages generated by the services provide a lightweight framework to inspect and test services.

But sometimes you need a little more information. Collecting data from multiple map services requires visiting each link, then going back and visiting the next link. Remembering field names and properties can be a hassle. 

The [ESRI REST Diagnostics](https://github.com/raykendo/ESRI_REST_Diagnostics) tools were designed to make the pages easier to query and use. Over 15 bookmarklets were developed to help map service testing and querying. 

The [ArcGIS REST Enhanced](https://github.com/raykendo/ArcGIS-REST-Enhanced) project is a Chrome extension that packs all the features of ESRI REST Diagnostics into one tool. Depending on the ArGIS REST Service page you're visiting, this Chrome Extension will present appropriate controls to help you work with your ArcGIS Server map services.
